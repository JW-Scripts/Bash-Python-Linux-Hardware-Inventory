# Linux-Hardware-Inventory
This Hardware Inventory takes a hybrid approach using Bash and Python together. 

Root privileges must be estabilshed and enabled prior to execution of these scripts. 

Open the "Bash-Hardware-Info-Grab.sh" file, and Change Directories in the script as needed. 
Use the "Bash-Hardware-Info-Grab.sh" from the source computer. This will Send the "Python-Proxy-Hardware-Script.py" to the remote Linux servers/nodes. 

The Python Script will activate upon successful delivery. 
From there, Bash will take the information gathered, and save the results to the source computer.
